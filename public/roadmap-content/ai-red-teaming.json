Distinct from traditional cybersecurity red teaming, it focuses on the unique attack surfaces of AI models, such as prompt manipulation, data poisoning, model extraction, and evasion techniques. The primary goal for an AI Red Teamer is to test the robustness, safety, alignment, and fairness of AI systems, particularly complex ones like LLMs, by adopting an attacker's mindset to uncover hidden flaws and provide actionable feedback for improvement.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",

    "description": "Prompt hacking is a core technique for AI Red Teamers targeting LLMs. It involves crafting inputs (prompts) to manipulate the model into bypassing safety controls, revealing hidden information, or performing unintended actions. Red teamers systematically test various prompt hacking methods (like jailbreaking, role-playing, or instruction manipulation) to assess the LLM's resilience against adversarial user input.\n\nLearn more from the following resources:",
