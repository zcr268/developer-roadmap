# Distillation
 
Distillation trains a smaller student model to emulate a larger teacher model by exposing it to the teacher's probability distributions, not just its final outputs. Unlike fine-tuning on synthetic data, distillation transfers the teacher's reasoning behavior. The resulting student model is smaller and faster while retaining much of the teacher's quality on the same tasks.
