# End-to-End Metrics
 
End-to-end latency includes inference time, network round-trip, queue time, and client-side overhead. Inference-only metrics tell you how well the model server performs; end-to-end metrics tell you what users actually experience. When inference time is fast but end-to-end time is slow, the bottleneck is in infrastructure or client code, not the GPU.
