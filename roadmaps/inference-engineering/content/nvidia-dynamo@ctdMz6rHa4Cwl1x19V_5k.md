# NVIDIA Dynamo
 
Dynamo is NVIDIA's open-source distributed serving platform that sits above inference engines and provides orchestration for large-scale deployments. It adds KV-aware routing, disaggregated prefill/decode serving, multi-node parallelism, and an SLA-based planner that dynamically adjusts the number of prefill and decode workers based on TTFT and TPS targets.
